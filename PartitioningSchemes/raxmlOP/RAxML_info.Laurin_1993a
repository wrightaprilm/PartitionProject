Alignment has 86 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 11.80%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 22 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
