Alignment has 84 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 27.09%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 15 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

WARNING the alpha parameter with a value of 10.029147 estimated by RAxML for partition number 12 with the name "Subset13"
is larger than 10.000000. You should do a model test and confirm that you actually need to incorporate a model of rate heterogeneity!
You can run inferences with a plain substitution model (without rate heterogeneity) by specifyng the CAT model and the "-V" option!
